My solution was quite different, i think, first i created database that will contain the the title of the insurance, 
since the data(title) could be quite dynamic, then i created another table that takes the title database as foreignkey
so it could related back to the data easily.

so the user can create any amount of insurance type they, with infinite option to create fields that automatically relates
to it.
